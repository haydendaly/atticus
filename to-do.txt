Need to fix populate for book data on /clubs/get/:clubID/?populate=true
Make searchBooks wrapped in /routes/books/searchBook/:query
Populate homescreen maybe have a request run on a daily schedule that looks at top lists and chooses random ids from them then stores list of those ids under some data for the "daily picks" on the homescreen which would then would iterate through create and populate all for homescreen
Add TravisCI testing for pipeline to ensure working before deployment
