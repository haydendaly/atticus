Hayden:
* Make book on Club View Screen Touchable Opacity leading to BookView
* Sketch out Club View Screen Mockup
* Push to TestFlight / Google Play

Bruno:
* Work on Club View Screen
  * Progress endpoint works, have bar responsive in realtime (can use componentsDidMount if you use a class over functional component)

Scott:
* Implement Club Info Screen
  * Add share button for invite code that'll open messages with link to app download (not that intimidating-- https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share)
  * Leave Club Button

Miriam:
* Overall Styling of App
  * Consistency Throughout Views
* Change positioning in create view from absolute to using flex
  * Might look a bit better if the create club portion is a bit higher up on the Screen
    * You can wrap both the sections in views and set the flex in the styling of them to something (like) .4 and .5 and then have a marginTop of like 10 on the lower Container

Madeleine:
* Book View
  * Remove space between Description and the container on the top
  * Color Buttons (maybe add Amazon Logo on Amazon Button)
    * Can create view inside touchable opacity and set FlexDirection to row and then use text and icon
  * Make Vertical Margins on book slightly larger

All:
* Put together presentation based on rubric
* Suggest more UI changes!
